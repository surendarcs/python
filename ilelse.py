'''Python Conditions and If statements
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.'''
######1
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
######2
#Elif - The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
######3 Else - The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
#######4 Nested If -  You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.
x = 41

if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20.")
